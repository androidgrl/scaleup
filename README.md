#Scale Up

In this project, the Scale Up, I optimized an existing project for performance and load. A few of the focuses of the project were:

* Handling a database with large numbers of records
* Handling heavy request volume/throughput
* Diagnosing and fixing performance bottlenecks (without compromising existing features)
* Monitoring production (error and performance) behavior of an application
